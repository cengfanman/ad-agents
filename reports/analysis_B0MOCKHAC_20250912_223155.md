## üîç Step-by-Step Analysis

STEP_BY_STEP_ANALYSIS
**Step 1: ads_metrics**
- **Decision-Making Process:** The agent began by examining advertising metrics, particularly focusing on the potential waste from broad match keywords (h5_broad_match_waste).
- **Findings:** It discovered that the keyword "wireless mouse" in a broad match had significant impressions but possibly low conversion, indicating wasted ad spend.
- **Significance:** This step was crucial for identifying inefficiencies in the ad spend that might be inflating ACOS.
- **Belief Update:** The agent increased its belief in listing quality issues, suggesting that improving the listing might enhance conversions and reduce waste.
**Step 2: listing_audit**
- **Decision-Making Process:** With an increased belief in listing quality issues, the agent audited the listing to assess attributes like title keyword coverage, image quality, and ratings.
- **Findings:** The listing had decent keyword coverage and image score, but there might be room for improvement in ratings and content.
- **Significance:** Ensuring high listing quality is fundamental to converting ad traffic into sales, thus impacting ACOS positively.
**Step 3: competitor**
- **Decision-Making Process:** The agent analyzed the competitive landscape to understand external pressures that might affect listing performance.
- **Findings:** The competitive analysis revealed strong competition with higher ratings and significant sponsored ad presence.
- **Significance:** This discovery highlighted the need to potentially adjust pricing or enhance the value proposition to remain competitive.
- **Belief Update:** The agent increased its belief in competitor pressure, recognizing it as a factor affecting performance.
**Step 4: inventory**
- **Decision-Making Process:** The agent checked inventory status to see if it could impact listing performance.
- **Findings:** It found a high stockout risk with only 12 days of inventory and a restock ETA of 5 days.
- **Significance:** Inventory issues can lead to lost sales opportunities and affect ad performance, thus influencing ACOS.
- **Belief Update:** The agent adjusted its belief in low bids, suggesting that maintaining optimal inventory levels is crucial for consistent ad performance.
